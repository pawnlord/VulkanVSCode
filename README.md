# VulkanVSCode Template
A template project for myself and anyone who wants it.

## Requirements
This template uses the Visual Studio 2022 x64 compiler toolchain and CMake.  
GLFW version 3.3.8 is included for easier setup. However, Vulkan itself is not included, as that is expected to be installed to your root directory.  
This project was created using Vulkan 1.3.250.1
